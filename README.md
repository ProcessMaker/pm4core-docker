# ProcessMaker 4 Core Docker Instance

This docker-compose setup allows you to quickly start up an instance of ProcessMaker4 Core to test with.

This build has no enterprise packages.

## Requirements
- Docker Engine >= 3.2
  - For Mac and Windows Users, we recommend [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - For other installation options: [Install Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- Docker Compose >= 1.2
  - If using Docker Desktop, Compose is already included
  - For all others: [Install Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Running an instance

1. Clone or download this repo

1. Modify the .env file *(optional)*

   | Variable | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | PM_VERSION | The version to install from dockerhub. Must match one of the tags at https://hub.docker.com/r/processmaker/pm4-core/tags or [build it locally](#building-the-application-image-locally)|
   | PM_APP_URL | The base URL that's accessible from outside the container. This will usually be `http://localhost` but you can change it if you customize your hosts file and add `extra_hosts` to the docker-compose.yml |
   | PM_APP_PORT | Choose a different port if 8080 is in use on your host |
   | PM_BROADCASTER_PORT | Choose a different port for the Socket.io server if 6001 is in use on your host |
   | PM_DOCKER_SOCK | Location of your docker socket file. See [note](#bind-mounting-the-docker-socket) |

   If you are configuring the image to connect to a different mysql or redis database you can remove them from the docker compose file and then alter the following variables from their default values:

   | Variable | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | PM_DB_HOST | host for the mysql server |
   | PM_DB_PORT | port for the mysql server |
   | PM_DB_NAME | database name |
   | PM_DB_USERNAME | mysql database username |
   | PM_DB_PASSWORD | mysql database password |
   | PM_REDIS_HOST | redis host |


1. Setup External DB *(optional)*

  If you want to use a different mysql database other than the one in the compose file then you will need to change the custom env settings, remove mysql from the docker-compose file and setup the database and user in mysql. You can use the following commands to setup the datbase (Change the username and password to match what you put in the custom env file.)

  ```
  create database processmaker CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
  grant ALL on processmaker.* TO pm@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  ```

1. Run `docker-compose up`

   This will pull the image if it doesn't exist. It's >2 gigabytes so it could take some time.

   If this is the first time running, it will run the install script and seed the database.
   This part usually takes a few minutes but if script executor images need to be downloaded and built it will take a few extra minutes.

   The instance should now be available at http://localhost:8080 (or where ever you configured it in the .env file)

   Username: **admin** Password: **admin123**

   `ctrl+c` will gracefully stop all containers but will not remove them so changes will persist.

   If you need a clean environment or made changes to config files, you can reinstall with
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Building the application image locally
If you want to build your own version locally, run docker build with PM_VERSION set to a tag at https://github.com/ProcessMaker/processmaker/tags (without the leading 'v')
```
docker build --build-arg PM_VERSION=4.1.21 -t processmaker/pm4-core:local .
```
Then change PM_VERSION in .env to `local`

## Building the base image locally
The pm4-base image includes all the prerequisites for PM4. It's available at https://hub.docker.com/r/processmaker/pm4-base

If you need to modify it you can edit Dockerfile.base and build it yourself with
```
docker build -t pm4-base:local -f Dockerfile.base .
```
After building the base image, change `FROM` at the top of the Dockerfile and rebuild the application image the [above instructions](#building-the-application-image-locally)

## Bind-mounting the docker socket
The instance uses the host's docker server by bind-mounting your docker sock file.
This allows for smaller images and better performance than using dind (docker in docker).
See [this post](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/) for more info.
The host socket file is usually at /var/run/docker.sock but can be changed in the .env file

## Todo

### Automated builds pushed to dockerhub

Currently, the image must be built and pushed to dockerhub manually using the
[instructions above](#building-the-application-image-locally) when a new tag of PM4
is released.

The goal is to have CircleCI do this automatically


### Use production build

Currently the image is built using development as the target (e.g. `npm run dev`). Building for production for Node and Composer packages
should greatly reduce the image size and might increase performance.
